"""
        Generate embeddings from a URL or a PDF file.

        This function checks if the provided input is a URL. If so, it scrapes the website and extracts its text.
        Otherwise, it assumes the input is PDF content and extracts the text from the PDF file. The extracted text is then
        used to create embeddings, which are linked to the provided session ID.

        Parameters
        ----------
        input_str : str
            The URL of the website or the name of the PDF file to be processed.
        file : File, optional
            The PDF file to extract text from if `input_str` is not a URL. Default is None.
        session_id : str
            A required unique identifier for the session. This ID is used to link the embeddings to a session.

        Returns
        -------
        dict
            A dictionary containing the generated embeddings associated with the session ID.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If the session_id is not provided.
